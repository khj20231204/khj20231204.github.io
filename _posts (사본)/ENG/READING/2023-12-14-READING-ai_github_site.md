On GitHub, the relationship between a fork and a pull request is as follows:
    1. Fork: Forking a repository creates a copy of the original repository under your GitHub account. This allows you to freely make changes to the code without affecting the original repository. A fork essentially creates a separate branch of the codebase that you have control over.
    2. Pull Request: A pull request is a way to propose changes made in your forked repository to be merged into the original repository. After making changes in your fork, you can submit a pull request to notify the original repository’s maintainers about your proposed changes. It serves as a formal request to review, discuss, and potentially merge your changes into the main codebase.

The typical workflow involving a fork and a pull request is as follows:
    1. Fork the repository: Go to the original repository on GitHub and click on the “Fork” button. This creates a copy of the repository under your GitHub account.
    2. Make changes: In your forked repository, you can make changes, add new features, fix bugs, or improve the code as desired. These changes will be made in a separate branch within your fork.
    3. Create a pull request: Once you are satisfied with the changes in your fork, you can create a pull request. This notifies the maintainers of the original repository about your proposed changes.
    4. Review and discussion: The maintainers and other contributors can review your changes, leave comments, ask questions, and provide feedback on the pull request. This allows for collaboration and discussion around the proposed changes.
    5. Merge or close the pull request: Based on the feedback and discussions, the maintainers of the original repository can choose to merge your changes into the main branch if they are satisfied with the modifications. Alternatively, they can request further changes, or if deemed unsuitable, they can close the pull request.

The relationship between a fork and a pull request enables a decentralized and collaborative approach to contribute to open source projects or collaborate on codebases. It allows individuals to work on their own copies of a repository, propose changes, and seek consensus before integrating those changes into the original project.
